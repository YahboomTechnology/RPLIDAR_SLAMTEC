# Slamtec RPLIDAR Lidar SLAM A1 A2 A3 S1 S2 MapperM2 support Mapping navigation for ROS robot

# Introduction
SLAM lidar is currently the most popular and cost-effective lidar in the open source hardware field. It possess small size and excellent quality, support 360Â° scanning and distance measurement, can be used on a personal computer or Jetson NANO Raspberry Pi and other micro-controllers by a USB data cable. We will provide many tutorial materials and codes, and ROS robot learning materials. These lidar are divided into 6 different models, each of which has a different shape and performance, and users can choose according to their requirements.
